    Voice and Image Recognition Integration:
        For voice recognition, after processing and validating the spoken move, update the GUI board and check if an engine move is needed (in human vs. engine mode).
        For image recognition, once a move is recognized and validated, the same procedure should follow â€“ update the GUI and possibly trigger an engine move.
