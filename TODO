    Game Mode Selection:
        It would be beneficial to have a clear selection mechanism for the different modes of play (human vs. human, human vs. engine, etc.). This could be implemented as a menu or buttons in the GUI.
        Depending on the selected mode, the system's behavior (such as how it responds to moves and who makes the next move) will change.

    Voice and Image Recognition Integration:
        For voice recognition, after processing and validating the spoken move, update the GUI board and check if an engine move is needed (in human vs. engine mode).
        For image recognition, once a move is recognized and validated, the same procedure should follow â€“ update the GUI and possibly trigger an engine move.

    Endgame Handling:
        Clearly define how the game concludes in different scenarios (checkmate, stalemate, draw, resignation). This might include disabling further moves, displaying a concluding message, and offering options to restart or exit.
